              As a Junior Software Developer/Engineer, I possess a versatile and comprehensive skill set that spans across software, hardware, mobile development, and cloud technologies. With proficiency in Python, C/C++, Objective-C, Swift, Java, MySQL, Oracle, and XML, I excel in building robust systems from the ground up. My expertise in development environments such as Xcode, Visual Studio, and GitHub, along with tools like Maven and D2P, enables me to streamline complex workflows and deliver high-performance applications.
              I have deep experience with mobile development on iOS and Android, including Mobile Device Management, multithreading, and event-driven processing.

On the hardware side, I specialize in EMV L2, Contactless Kernels, and card security technologies like DUKPT, adhering to PCI Compliance and ANSI x9.24 standards.
              In the cloud domain, I am adept at deploying and managing applications on AWS and Azure, while my knowledge of network protocols like HTTPs, TCP/IP, REST, SOAP, and Bluetooth ensures secure and optimized communication across systems. With additional strengths in DevOps, Machine Learning, and operating systems, I can drive innovation across every layer of technology.
